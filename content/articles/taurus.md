## Overview
### The Challenge<br />
In 12 weeks, go through the design process and research the problem of Media Representation and design a solution.
<br /><br />

### Background
With the pandemic, there has been a large uptrend in online grocery shopping and curbside pickup among families, caretakers, and individuals with busy schedules. Our team investigate this trend and dug deeper, noticing that marketing claims and keywords played a large part in consumer purchase decisions. To bridge the gap between what is seenon the packaging and the reality of the product, Taurus was born. 
<br /><br />

### Problem
In this age of media information overload, users are susceptible to overreaching product claims, especially if they can't spend time and effort to interpret product labels or research marketing claims.
<br /><br />

### Solution
We present Taurus, a browser extension that alert users while online shopping and provides information on misleading or false marketing claims on the product label. With Taurus, users can make more objective food purchases at the digital point-of-sale.
<br /><br />

### The Problem
In this age of media information overload, users are susceptible to overreaching product claims, especially if they can't spend time and effort to interpret product labels or research marketing claims.
<br /><br />

### Our Approach
We used the Double Diamond process as our guideline, and remained flexible based on our own research needs. 
More specifically, the activities we led included:
<br /><br />

### My Contribution
I designed the extension and iterated with the help of user testing, peer, and mentor feedback, and partnered with the PMs on product and business strategy. I conducted primary and secondary research, designed the end-to-end interaction flow, and prototyped the extension in Figma. I also contributed to the research of literature review and competitive analysis.
<br /><br />

## Research
We started by talking to people, identifying their problems, and delineating user needs. Due to the open ended problem space of media representation, we initially conducted 10 high-level interviews to understand what pain points potential users were experiencing. 
<br /><br />

### Interviews
We conducted several semi-structured interviews with individuals starting with asking what misrepresentation meant to them.
<br /><br />

Our findings led us to narrow down on outcomes we wanted to see, mainly focusing on misinformation.
Some discussions among the team surrounding this topic included questioning who we should build for, considering  that we may never be able to persuade some people to view misrepresentation.
<br /><br />

At this point in the process, our starting point was to look into obtaining objective information, reduce misrepresentation, and how to get folks who are misinformed to get objective information.
<br /><br />

When we conducted a second round of interviews, we asked about three main areas of the consumer shopping experience. 
<br /><br />

<p class="quote">“ Tell me about your product purchase journey ”</p>
<br />
<p class="quote">“ What concerns, if any, do you have when making a product purchase decision? ”</p>
<br />
<p class="quote">“ What do you wish there was to help you make that easier? ”</p>
<br />

We synthesized our results using affinity mapping and gained the following insights:
<br /><br />

<ul class="list-disc mx-5">
  <li>Most of the consumers look at food labels when purchasing.</li>
  <li>Users tend to not read food labels for items that are repeat purchases.</li>
  <li>People prefer the in-store experience when purchasing produce.</li>
  <li>When reading nutrition labels and ingredients, people tend to only look at the first few ingredients of a product.</li>
  <li>People think serving sizes confuse them when reading nutrition labels.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

### Secondary Research
Driven by the initial interviews and the time constraint, we narrowed down misinformation to the area of consumer products. This led us to the space of marketing claim misrepresentation in food products.
<br /><br />

We looked into studies and articles that focus on shopping behaviour and effects of misleading food claims.
<br /><br />

Our main findings include: 
<br /><br />

<ul class="list-disc mx-5">
  <li>A year ago, 81 percent of shoppers said they never turned to the internet for groceries. Online shopping was lolling at around 3 percent of all grocery sales, or about $1.2 billion, according to [a survey] by Brick Meets Click/Mercatus.</li>
  <li>But in June, online grocery sales in the United States hit $7.2 billion.</li>
  <li>90% Of consumers use health claims to decide which foods to buy, with many not actually reading the product label</li>
  <li>Parents honored children's requests for food about 50% of the time, soft drinks (60%), cookies (50%), and candy (45%)</li>
  <li>Food advertisers spend large amounts of money targeting children, in an attempt to build brand loyalty and to persuade them to desire a particular food product, starting when they are toddlers.</li>
  <li>There are no governing criteria of what can be stocked in healthy food stores, so the true health benefits of these products are largely unknown</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

The results motivated us to:
<ul class="list-disc mx-5">
  <li>Focus on consumers who are swayed by health claims in their puchase decisions.</li>
  <li>Conduct more interviews to verify who we should narrow down our target audience to...</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

### Competitive Analysis
We conducted a competitive analysis on existing products aimed to diminish misinformation on various platforms. To our knowledge, there is no existing service that directly addresses health claim misinformation.
<br /><br /><br />

  <img class="flex-auto object-scale-down content-center px-10 py-5" src="./images/taurus/brand5.jpg" />
</div>
<br /><br />

### Key Takeaways
From the analysis and second round of interviews, we then grouped and identified themes from our qualitative interview data. 

Consistent with our secondary research, we decide on helping parents and caretakers because that group purchases groceries and focuses on health claims for their dependents. As a result, we decided to focus on the online shopping experience as our point of intervention, as this has the largest potential for improvement while staying in line with our desired outcome of minimizing misinformation.

We narrowed down the users’ needs to:

### Persona
Based on the secondary research and interviews, I took the lead to create the following personas to help up guide our design.
<br /><br />

</div>
<br /><br />


## Design
### Ideation
As a group, we used the crazy eights method to ideate potential solutions. We then each presented our ideas, grouped similar ideas, and offered critique to each other's ideas.
<br /><br />

We reviewed the problem statement and kept user goals in mind, and analyzed all of our solutions through the lens of the problem statement.
<br /><br />

These were some of our initial ideas:
<br />
<ul class="list-disc mx-5">
  <li>An app where food information can be crowdsourced. Items are ranked green, yellow, red. Maybe the items can be tailored to you (e.g., can't eat gluten). Some items are yellow if they are known to cause or trigger "xyz."</li>
  <li>A BS meter (like Snopes) rating food items on a scale of Truth</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />

### Our Solution
Based on the data gathered, we voted on ideas based on feasibility and alignment with the ideal outcome.
Thus, we arrived at our solution: A browser extension that identifies products with misleading claims, and provides information to the user to inform them of the potential purchase.
<br /><br />

We chose a browser extension as online grocery orders are placed from the merchant website, which are done in a browser compared to an app. Using compiled information from a database, the extension will then match product information to the items searched, and will call out the products in the search results with misleading marketing claims. The output of the call out boxes will be sourced from research based on FDA guidelines and research literature.
<br /><br />

Products which have claims but are not misleading will not be marked by the extension.
<br /><br />

### Defining the MVP
I mapped out a user flow, and discussed with team members to determine our MVP features. Due to limited resources and timeframe of the project, we had to prioritize and leave some features on the backlog.
<br /><br />

After discussions with the engineers on technical and time constraints, we identified the following key features for the demo:
<br /><br />

<ul class="list-disc mx-5">
  <li>Extension onboarding information</li>
  <li>Limit to one food category: cereal</li>
  <li>Featured on one merchant website - Target.com</li>
  <li>Browser interception on the product page, after clicking into the product</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />

### User Flow
Based off our research, we created a basic outline of the user journey of their shopping experience with and without the product.
<br /><br />
<div class="flex flex-row mx-auto max-w-4xl">
  <img src="./images/taurus/flow.jpg" />
</div>
<br /><br />

### Sketches & Wireframes
I created a lo-fi wireflow to help make sure that everyone was on the same page. We also used this to discuss feasibility of individual features and prioritize them in our development timeline:
<br /><br />
<div class="flex flex-row mx-auto max-w-4xl">
  <img src="./images/taurus/wireframe.jpg" />
</div>
<br /><br />

### Mid-fidelity Design Iteration 1
Based on the secondary research and interviews, I took the lead to create the following personas to help up guide our design.
<br /><br />
<div class="flex flex-row mx-auto max-w-4xl">
  <img src="./images/taurus/iteration.jpg" />
</div>
<br /><br />

### Usability Testing & Iteration
We created the following wireframes and created a survey for our potential users for feedback.
<br /><br />
Due to team flow and time constraints, I conducted usability testing with a Mid-fidelity clickable prototype, with the the goal of measuring navigation and the call to action feature of the button.
<br /><br />
<div class="flex flex-row flex-wrap">
  <img class="flex-auto object-scale-down content-center mx-6" src="./images/taurus/usability.jpg" />
  <img class="flex-auto object-scale-down content-center mx-6" src="./images/taurus/testing.jpg" />
</div>
<br /><br />

### The MVP
Here is the final clickable Prototype.
