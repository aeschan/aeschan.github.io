## Overview
### The Challenge<br />
In 12 weeks, go through the design process and research the problem of Media Representation and design a solution.
<br /><br />

### Background
With the pandemic, there has been a large uptrend in online grocery shopping and curbside pickup among families, caretakers, and individuals with busy schedules. Our team investigate this trend and dug deeper, noticing that marketing claims and keywords played a large part in consumer purchase decisions. To bridge the gap between what is seenon the packaging and the reality of the product, Taurus was born. 
<br /><br />

### Solution
We designed MealTap, a digital card loyalty program, exclusively for prepared food shoppers at Whole Foods. The program aims to ease the frustration of long express checkout lines and give shoppers the same autonomy and independence in the payment process that they enjoy in the meal-selection process. 

Overall, the recommended program reaps financial reward for Whole Foods as a result of faster checkout, higher rates of customer satisfaction, and increased meal loyalty.

### The Problem
In this age of media information overload, users are susceptible to overreaching product claims, especially if they can't spend time and effort to interpret product labels or research marketing claims.
<br /><br />

### Our Approach
We used the Double Diamond process as our guideline, and remained flexible based on our own research needs. 
More specifically, the activities we led included:
<br /><br />

### My Contribution
I designed the extension and iterated with the help of user testing, peer, and mentor feedback, and partnered with the PMs on product and business strategy. I conducted primary and secondary research, designed the end-to-end interaction flow, and prototyped the extension in Figma. I also contributed to the research of literature review and competitive analysis.
<br /><br />

## Research
We started by talking to people, identifying their problems, and delineating user needs. Due to the open ended problem space of media representation, we initially conducted 10 high-level interviews to understand what pain points potential users were experiencing. 
<br /><br />

### Interviews
We conducted several semi-structured interviews with individuals starting with asking what misrepresentation meant to them.

Our findings led us to narrow down on outcomes we wanted to see, mainly focusing on misinformation.
Some discussions among the team surrounding this topic included questioning who we should build for, considering  that we may never be able to persuade some people to view misrepresentation.

At this point in the process, our starting point was to look into obtaining objective information, reduce misrepresentation, and how to get folks who are misinformed to get objective information.

When we conducted a second round of interviews, we asked about three main areas of the consumer shopping experience. 

We synthesized our results using affinity mapping and gained the following insights:

Most of the consumers look at food labels when purchasing.
Users tend to not read food labels for items that are repeat purchases.
People prefer the in-store experience when purchasing produce.
When reading nutrition labels and ingredients, people tend to only look at the first few ingredients of a product.
People think serving sizes confuse them when reading nutrition labels.
<br /><br />

### Secondary Research
Driven by the initial interviews and the time constraint, we narrowed down misinformation to the area of consumer products. This led us to the space of marketing claim misrepresentation in food products.

We looked into studies and articles that focus on shopping behaviour and effects of misleading food claims.

Our main findings include: 

A year ago, 81 percent of shoppers said they never turned to the internet for groceries. Online shopping was lolling at around 3 percent of all grocery sales, or about $1.2 billion, according to [a survey] by Brick Meets Click/Mercatus.
But in June, online grocery sales in the United States hit $7.2 billion.
90% Of consumers use health claims to decide which foods to buy, with many not actually reading the product label
Parents honored children's requests for food about 50% of the time, soft drinks (60%), cookies (50%), and candy (45%)
Food advertisers spend large amounts of money targeting children, in an attempt to build brand loyalty and to persuade them to desire a particular food product, starting when they are toddlers.
There are no governing criteria of what can be stocked in healthy food stores, so the true health benefits of these products are largely unknown

The results motivated us to:

Focus on consumers who are swayed by health claims in their puchase decisions.
Conduct more interviews to verify who we should narrow down our target audience to
<br /><br />

### Competitive Analysis
We conducted a competitive analysis on existing products aimed to diminish misinformation on various platforms. To our knowledge, there is no existing service that directly addresses health claim misinformation.
<br /><br />

### Key Takeaways
From the analysis and second round of interviews, we then grouped and identified themes from our qualitative interview data. 

Consistent with our secondary research, we decide on helping parents and caretakers because that group purchases groceries and focuses on health claims for their dependents. As a result, we decided to focus on the online shopping experience as our point of intervention, as this has the largest potential for improvement while staying in line with our desired outcome of minimizing misinformation.

We narrowed down the usersâ€™ needs to:
