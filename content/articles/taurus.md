      <p>
        WholeFoods prepared meal shoppers enjoy the customizable and fast experience of butying meals from the hot and cold food bars, but their end experience of waiting in the ironically long “express” checkout lines leaves them frustrated.

      <p class="quote">“How might we, Whole Foods, help prepared meal shoppers to reduce frustration with their experience in the long weigh-and-pay process?”</p>
      <br>
      <h1 class="heading">Solution</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        We designed MealTap, a digital card loyalty program, exclusively for prepared food shoppers at Whole Foods. The program aims to ease the frustration of long express checkout lines and give shoppers the same autonomy and independence in the payment process that they enjoy in the meal-selection process. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Overall, the recommended program reaps financial reward for Whole Foods as a result of faster checkout, higher rates of customer satisfaction, and increased meal loyalty.
